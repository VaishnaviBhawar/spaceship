# Operators in Javascript

Operators are used to perform certain operations on one or more values or variables.

# Operand

Operands are values or variables on which operation is performed.

**Some common types of operators include:**

1. Arithmetic operators (+, -, \*, /, % )
2. Assignment operators (=, +=, -=, \*=, /=, %=)
3. Increment & Decrement operators(var++, ++var), (var--, --var)
4. Comparison operators (<, >, <=, >=, ==, ===, != )
5. Logical operators (&& (logical AND), || (logical OR), ! (logical NOT))
6. other operators (typeof, Comma, String, Dot)

### Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators perform basic mathematical computations on values.

**1. Addition Operator (+)**

The addition operator (`+`) is used to add two numbers together.

**Code :**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello JS ðŸ’›</title>
    <script>
      const a = 10;
      const b = 20;
      const result = a + b;
      document.write(result);
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

**Output**

> 30

This code defines three variable : `a` is assigned the value `10`, `b` is assigned the value `20`, and `result` is assigned the value of the sum of `a` and `b`, which is `30`.

The document.write() method is then used to output the value of `result` to the document, which will display as the number `30` in the rendered HTML.

**2. Subtraction Operator (-)**

The subtraction operator (-) subtracts one number from another.

**Code**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello JS ðŸ’›</title>
    <script>
      const a = 10;
      const b = 20;
      const result = a - b;
      document.write(result);
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

**Output**

> -10

This code defines three variable : `a` is assigned the value `10`, `b` is assigned the value `20`, and `result` is assigned the value of the subtract of `a` and `b`, which is `-10`.

The document.write() method is then used to output the value of `result` to the document, which will display as the number `-10` in the rendered HTML.

**3. Multiplication Operator**

The multiplication operator (`*`) multiplies two numbers.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello JS ðŸ’›</title>
    <script>
      const a = 8;
      const b = 5;
      const result = a * b;
      document.write(result);
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

**Output**

> 40

This code defines three variable : `a` is assigned the value `8`, `b` is assigned the value `5`, and `result` is assigned the value of the multiplication of `a` and `b`, which is `40`.

The document.write() method is then used to output the value of `result` to the document, which will display as the number `40` in the rendered HTML.

**4. Division Operator (/)**

The division operator (`/`) divides one number by another.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello JS ðŸ’›</title>
    <script>
      const a = 8;
      const b = 5;
      const result = a / b;
      document.write(result);
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

**Output**

> 1.6

This code defines three variable : `a` is assigned the value `8`, `b` is assigned the value `5`, and `result` is assigned the value of the division of `a` and `b`, which is `1.6`.

The document.write() method is then used to output the value of `result` to the document, which will display as the number `1.6` in the rendered HTML.

**5. Modulus Operator (%)**

The modulus operator (`%`) returns the remainder of a division operation.

**Code**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello JS ðŸ’›</title>
    <script>
      const a = 10;
      const b = 3;
      const result = a % b;
      document.write(result);
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

**Output**

> 1

This code calculates the remainder of dividing the value of `a` by the value of `b` using the modulus operator `%`. In this case, `a` is assigned value of `10` and `b` is assigned value of `3`. The result of the operation is assigned to a variable named `result`. Finally, the value of result is outputted to the browser using the `document.write` function.

The output of this code snippet will be `1`. This is because `10` can be divided by `3` three times with a remainder of `1`. Therefore, the value of result will be `1`.

### Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

**1. equals to (=)**

The equals to operator (`=`) assigns a value to a variable.

**Code**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello JS ðŸ’›</title>
    <script>
      const result = 50;
      document.write(result);
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

**Output**

> 50

This code declare a variable named `result` using the `let` keyword and assigns it a value of `50`. The `document.write` method is then used to output the value of the `result` variable.

When this code is executed, it will output the value `50` to the web page.

It's important to note that the `let` keyword is used to declare a variable that can be reassigned later in the code. This means that the value of the `result` variable can be changed later in the code if needed.

**2. plus equals to (+=)**

The plus equals to operator (`+=`) adds a value to the current value of a variable.

**Code**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello JS ðŸ’›</title>
    <script>
      let balance = 500;
      document.write("Current Balance :" + balance);

      balance += 20;

      document.write("<br/> New Balance:" + balance);
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

**Output**

> Current Balance :500 <br/>
> New Balance:520

**3. minus equals to (-=)**

The minus equals to operator (`-=`) subtracts a value from the current value of a variable.

**Code**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello JS ðŸ’›</title>
    <script>
      let balance = 500;
      document.write("Current Balance :" + balance);

      balance -= 150;

      document.write("<br/> New Balance:" + balance);
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

**Output**

> Current Balance :500 <br/>
> New Balance:350

**4. multiplication equals to (\*=)**

The multiplication equals to operator (`*=`) multiplication a value from the current value of a variable.

**Code**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello JS ðŸ’›</title>
    <script>
      let balance = 500;
      document.write("Current Balance :" + balance);

      balance *= 150;

      document.write("<br/> New Balance:" + balance);
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

**Output**

> Current Balance :500 <br/>
> New Balance:75000

**5. division equals to (/=)**

The division equals to operator (`/=`) division a value from the current value of a variable.

**Code**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello JS ðŸ’›</title>
    <script>
      let balance = 500;
      document.write("Current Balance :" + balance);

      balance /= 150;

      document.write("<br/> New Balance:" + balance);
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

**Output**

> Current Balance :500 <br/>
> New Balance:3.3333

**6. modulus equals to (%=)**

The modulus equals to operator (`%=`) modulus a value from the current value of a variable.

**Code**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello JS ðŸ’›</title>
    <script>
      let balance = 500;
      document.write("Current Balance :" + balance);

      balance %= 150;

      document.write("<br/> New Balance:" + balance);
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

**Output**

> Current Balance :500 <br/>
> New Balance:50

### Increment & Decrement Operators

Increment and decrement operators increase or decrease the value of a variable.

## Increment Operator

There are two types of increment operators: The `pre-increment operator (++variable) ` and the `post-increment operator (variable++)`.

1.  **Post-Increment Operator (variable++):**

> The post-increment operator (`variable++`) increases the value of a variable by `1`, returning the original value before the increment.

**Code**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Post-Increment Operator</title>
    <script>
      let num = 21;
      let result = num++;
      console.log(result);
      console.log(num);
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

**Output**

> 21 <br/>
> 22

2.  **Pre-Increment Operator (++variable):**

The pre-increment operator (`++variable`) increases the value of a variable by `1`, returning the value after the increment.

**Code**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Pre-Increment Operator</title>
    <script>
      let num = 21;
      let result = ++num;
      console.log(result);
      console.log(num);
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

**Output**

> 22 <br/>
> 22

## Decrement Operator

There are two types of decrement operators: The `pre-decrement operator (--variable) ` and the `post-decrement operator (variable--)`.

1. **Post-Decrement Operator (variable--):**

The post-decrement operator (`variable--`) decreases the value of a variable by `1`, returning the original value before the decrement.

**Code**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Post-Decrement Operator</title>
    <script>
      let num = 21;
      let result = num--;
      console.log(result);
      console.log(num);
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

**Output**

> 21 <br/>
> 20

2. **Pre-Decrement Operator (--variable):**

The pre-decrement operator (`--variable`) decreases the value of a variable by `1`, returning the value after the decrement.

**Code**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Pre-Decrement Operator</title>
    <script>
      let num = 21;
      let result = --num;
      console.log(result);
      console.log(num);
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

**Output**

> 20 <br/>
> 20

## Comparison Operator

The comparison operator is used to compare two variable value and return a Boolean value of true or false. The comparison operator can be used to compare two values of the same data type.

**1. equal to (==)**

**Code**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello JS ðŸ’›</title>
    <script>
      let a = 10;
      let b = 10;
      document.write(a == b);
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

**Output**

> true

In above code will gives output `true` to the web page because the two variables `a` and `b` have the same value, which is `10`. The `==` operator is a comparison operator that checks if two values are equal to each other.

**2. strict equal to (===)**

**Code**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello JS ðŸ’›</title>
    <script>
      let a = 10;
      let b = 10;
      document.write(a === b);
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

**Output**

> true

With the === operator, the code will output true only if both a and b have the same value and are of the same type (in this case, both are numbers).

<img src="/javascript/04/difference(=).png" alt="difference(=, ==, ===)" width="800px"/>

**3. not equals to (!=)**

**Code**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello JS ðŸ’›</title>
    <script>
      let a = 10;
      let b = 20;
      document.write(a != b);
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

**Output**

> true

In the above code will gives output `true` to the web page because the two variables `a` and `b` are not equal to each other. The `!=` operator is the `not equal` operator in JavaScript, and it checks if two values are not equal to each other.

**4. less than (<)**

**Code**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello JS ðŸ’›</title>
    <script>
      let a = 5;
      let b = 10;

      let res = a < b;

      document.write(res);
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

**Output**

> true

In the above code will gives output `true` to the web page because the variable res is assigned the value of the expression `a<b` , which is true because `a` is less than `b`.

The `<` operator is the `less than` operator in JavaScript, and it checks if the value on the left is less than the value on the right. In this case, `a` has value of `5` and `b` has value of `10`, so the expression `a<b` evaluates to true. The result of this expression is then assigned to the variable res.

**5. greater than (>)**

**Code**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello JS ðŸ’›</title>
    <script>
      let a = 50;
      let b = 10;

      let res = a > b;

      document.write(res);
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

**Output**

> true

In the above code will gives output `true` to the web page because the variable res is assigned the value of the expression `a>b` , which is true because `a` is greater than `b`.

The `>` operator is the `greater than` operator in JavaScript, and it checks if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right. In this case, `a` has value of `50` and `b` has value of `10`, so the expression `a>b` evaluates to true. The result of this expression is then assigned to the variable res.

**6. less than or equals to (<=)**

**Code**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello JS ðŸ’›</title>
    <script>
      let a = 5;
      let b = 10;

      let res = a <= b;

      document.write(res);
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

**Output**

> true

In the above code will gives output `true` because the variable res is assigned the value of the expression `a<=b`, which is true because `a` is less than or equal to `b`.

In this code, the `<=` operator is the `less than or equal to` operator in JavaScript, and it checks if the value on the left is less than or equal to the value on the right. In this case, `a` has value of `5` and `b` has value of `10`, so the expression `a<=b` evaluates to true because `5` is less than or equal to `10`.

**7. greater than or equals to (>=)**

**Code**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello JS ðŸ’›</title>
    <script>
      let a = 50;
      let b = 10;

      let res = a >= b;

      document.write(res);
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

**Output**

> true

In the above code will gives output `true` because the variable res is assigned the value of the expression `a>=b`, which is true because `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.

In this code, the `>=` operator is the `greater than or equal to` operator in JavaScript, and it checks if the value on the left is greater than or equal to the value on the right. In this case, `a` has value of `50` and `b` has value of `10`, so the expression `a>=b` evaluates to true because `50` is greater than or equal to `10`.

## Logical Operator

In JavaScript, logical operators are used to evaluate logical expressions and return a Boolean value of `true` or `false`.

**1. AND operator(&&)**

This operator returns true if both operands are true, otherwise it returns false.

**Code**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello JS ðŸ’›</title>
    <script>
      let res = 5 > 3 && 4 > 2;

      document.write(res);
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

**Output**

> true

In the above code will gives output `true` This is because the `&&` (AND) operator evaluates both of its operands and returns true if both operands are true. In this case, the first operand `5 > 3` is `true`, and the second operand `4 > 2` is also `true`. Therefore, the expression `5 > 3 && 4 > 2` evaluates to `true` and is store to the variable `res`.

**2. OR operator(||)**

This operator returns true if at least one of the condition is true, otherwise it returns false.

**Code**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello JS ðŸ’›</title>
    <script>
      let res = 5 == 5 || 4 == 2;

      document.write(res);
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

**Output**

> true

In the above code will gives output `true` this is because the `||` (OR) operator evaluates both of its condition and returns `true` if at least one of the operands is `true`. In this case, the first operand `5 == 5` is `true`, and the second operand `4 == 2` is `false`. Therefore, the expression `5 == 5 || 4 == 2` evaluates to `true` and is store to the variable `res`.

**3. NOT operator (!)**

If the operand is true, it returns false, and if the operand is false, it returns true.

**Code**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello JS ðŸ’›</title>
    <script>
      document.write(8 != 5);
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

**Output :**

> true

In the above code will gives output `true` this is because the `!` (NOT) operator negates the boolean value of its operand. In this case, the operand is `8 == 5`, which evaluates to `false`. Therefore, the `!` operator negates this value to `true`.

### Modulus Operators:

The **modulus operator** is represented by the percent sign `%`. The modulus operator returns the `remainder` of a division operation. It is often used with integers, but it can also be used with floating-point numbers.

**Code**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello JS ðŸ’›</title>
    <script>
      const result = 10 % 3;
      document.write(result);
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

**Output**

> 1

In this example, `10 % 3` is calculating the remainder when 10 is divided by 3. The result is 1 because 10 divided by 3 is 3 with a remainder of 1.

## Other operator

**1. TYPEOF Operator:**

This **typeof** operator helps us to know the type of data, whether it is boolean, string, number, etc.

**Code**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Javascript</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <script>
      var a = true;
      var b = "Hello";
      var c = 42;

      console.log("The datatype of A is :- " + typeof a); // Output for: "boolean"
      console.log("The datatype of B is :- " + typeof b); // Output for: "string"
      console.log("The datatype of C is :- " + typeof c); // Output for: "number"
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

**Output**

> The datatype of A is :- boolean<br/>
> The datatype of B is :- string<br/>
> The datatype of C is :- number<br/>

In this example, we are obtaining the datatype of variables by utilizing the typeof operator.

**2.Comma operator**

This **comma operator** evaluates each of its operands (from left to right) and returns the value of the last operand. It is mainly used within a for loop to update multiple variables.

**Code**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>JavaScript</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <script>
      var x = 1,
        y = 2,
        z = 3;

      var result = (x++, y++, z++);

      console.log("Value of x is :- " + x);
      console.log("Value of y is :- " + y);
      console.log("Value of z is :- " + z);
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

**Output**

> Value of x is :- 2<br/>
> Value of y is :- 3<br/>
> Value of z is :- 4<br/>

In this example, the `comma operator` is used to evaluate the expressions x++, y++, and z++ sequentially. The variables x, y, and z are all `incremented by 1` as part of the evaluation.

**3. STRING Operator:**

This **string operator** is primarily used for concatenation, which means joining two or more strings together. In JavaScript, the`+`operator is used for this purpose.

**Code :**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>JavaScript</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <script>
      var str1 = "Hello";
      var str2 = "World";
      var str3 = "!";

      var greeting = str1 + " " + str2 + str3;

      console.log("Concatenated string is :- " + greeting);
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

**Output :**

> Concatenated string is :- Hello World!<br/>

In this example, the `+` operator is used to concatenate str1, str2, and str3 along with a space between str1 and str2. The final result is the concatenated string `"Hello World!"`.

**4. DOT Operator:**

This `dot operator (.)` is used to access properties and methods of an object in JavaScript.

**Code :**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>JavaScript</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <script>
      var person = {
        firstName: "Sujal",
        lastName: "Ugle",
        age: 20,
        fullName: function () {
          return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
        },
      };

      console.log("First name is :- " + person.firstName);
      console.log("Last name is :- " + person.lastName);
      console.log("Age is :- " + person.age);
      console.log("Full name is :- " + person.fullName());
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

**Output :**

First name is :- Sujal<br/>
Last name is :- Ugle<br/>
Age is :- 20<br/>
Full name is :- Sujal Ugle<br/>
